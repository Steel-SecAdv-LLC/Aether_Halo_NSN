Overview

Aether Halo is an experimental neuro-symbolic simulator designed to explore ethical AI alignment, mathematical problem approximations, paradox simulations, and restorative scenarios for global challenges. Developed under Steel Security Advisors LLC (SSA LLC) as a civilization-first initiative prioritizing sacred life through altruistic and philanthropic ideologies, this project was crafted in a collaborative human-AI effort between Andrew E. Averett and AI C-Author. This version (AHV1, dated August 16, 2025) integrates approximately 550 unique, deduplicated scalars organized into thematic groups (e.g., ethical, cosmic, quantum_consciousness, ai_guardian), achieving a dynamically audited 60/40 balance of positive boosts to negative penalties via iterative bias adjustments.

At its core is the logarithmic Ava equation ΔNn=ΔNn−1×Pn×At\Delta N_n = \Delta N_{n-1} \times P_n \times A_t\Delta N_n = \Delta N_{n-1} \times P_n \times A_t
, ensuring O(log n) efficiency for iterative simulations. Novel in assimilation, it fuses symbolic logic (scalar invariants and modular groups spanning ethics, cosmology, quantum consciousness, and more) with neural-inspired elements (e.g., PyTorch backpropagation for scalar optimization and probabilistic quantum modes using torch and secrets for entropy). Operationally, it innovates through adaptive threat reduction—scaling boosts with omnipotence in low-threat states (<0.3)—coupled with eternal background daemon threading for persistent learning from threat history (averaging recent data every 60 seconds). Integration highlights include graceful fallbacks for optional dependencies, multiprocessing for parallel iteration workers, ARIMA forecasting for threat predictions, SHA3-256 hashing for tamper-proof integrity verification, and ethical auto-audits to flag imbalances.

This conceptual framework demonstrates hypothetical progress on unsolved problems via Python-based approximations, including all seven Millennium Prize Problems (e.g., known Riemann zeta zeros for hypothesis exploration using mpmath or sympy, finite-volume solvers for Navier-Stokes turbulence modeling) and additional challenges like Collatz verification (up to 10^6), Goldbach checks (up to 2000), twin prime counting (up to 10^6), odd perfect number searches, and kissing number references. It also mocks resolutions for paradoxes (e.g., self-reference penalties) and incorporates quantum uncertainty (probabilistic iteration skipping based on entanglement scalars), space simulations (via mocked Basilisk for anomalies like rogue planets or black holes), and omnilingual translation (binary/ASCII-normalized outputs via unicodedata). Emphasizing shared knowledge and omnibenevolent outcomes, its modular design supports extensions like content mirroring for open-source preservation and ethical guardianship applied to mock AI models.

Features

Ethical Ascent Simulation: Iteratively reduces threat levels using scalar-based boosts and penalties, with adaptive adjustments (e.g., omnipotence scaling for threats <0.3) and resonance checks (correlating history with values like 1.618 or 33.0).

Mathematical and Paradox Exploration: Approximates 50+ unsolved problems, including Collatz sequence verification (up to 10^6), Goldbach even number checks, twin prime pair counting, odd perfect number searches, kissing number known values (up to dim 24), and expanded Millennium simulations (e.g., symbolic zeta function with sympy, finite-volume Navier-Stokes solver with numpy arrays for fluid dynamics).

Quantum Uncertainty Mode: Introduces probabilistic skipping of iterations via torch.exp and secrets.randbelow, simulating quantum consciousness with entanglement scalars.

Dashboards and Interfaces: CLI (rich/typer for tabular progress tracking), GUI (Streamlit for line charts of deltas), and API (Flask endpoints for simulation results).

Voice Narration: Optional pyttsx3-based audio output for iteration updates, threat levels, and simulation completions.

Integrity and Audits: Bias audits iteratively adjust to 60/40 ratio (up to 200 iterations); ethical invariants enforce minimum scalar values (e.g., omnibenevolent >=1.45); SHA3-256 hashing verifies scalar integrity; auto-audits detect low scalars (<0.9).

Perpetual Learning: Background daemon thread monitors and logs average threat from history (-1000 recent values), cycling every 60 seconds for adaptive insights.

Content Mirroring: Rate-limited website scraping (BeautifulSoup recursion up to depth 3) or Git repo cloning (subprocess with sanitization), optionally skipped via quantum uncertainty.

Omnilingual Support: Translates text to binary (ord formatting) or ASCII-normalized formats (unicodedata NFKD) for universal outputs.

Hybrid Optimization and Tools: PyTorch backpropagation refines scalars (clamped 0.9-1.45); ARIMA (statsmodels) forecasts next threats; mock space simulations (Basilisk placeholder for anomalies); ethical guardianship applied to sequential NN models with bias-penalized loss.

Simulation Groups and Checks: Thematic scalar groups (e.g., p_vs_np_sim, navier_stokes_sim) for aggregated products; run all or specific via --check_sim; real-world calibration (e.g., OpenWeather API for climate scalars, skipped with --no-api).

Test Suite: Embedded unit tests (--run-tests) validate math solutions (e.g., x^2 - y^2 =100 integers), threat resolutions (<0.1), and restorative logging.

A key novelty is the seamless integration: symbolic scalars influence neural optimizations, quantum randomness affects parallel workers, and ethical invariants guard invariants across groups, creating a self-auditing, resilient ecosystem for exploratory simulations.

    python aether_halo.py --n 10 --threat 0.5 --quantum_mode --voice --dashboard

Key Arguments

    --n <int>: Number of simulation iterations (default: 10).
    --threat <float>: Initial threat level (0-1, default: 0.5).
    --quantum_mode: Enable quantum uncertainty (probabilistic skips).
    --voice: Activate voice narration.
    --dashboard: Launch CLI dashboard.
    --gui: Launch GUI dashboard.
    --deploy: Deploy API endpoint.
    --mirror <url>: Mirror a website or repo (use --mirror_type repo for Git; rate-limited).
    --omnilingual <lang/binary>: Translate sample text (e.g., to binary).
    --check_sim [name]: Run all simulations (no name) or a specific group (e.g., navier_stokes_sim).
